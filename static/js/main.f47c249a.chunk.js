A guaranteed crowd pleaser that is comes together quickly and easily.",rec:"Take one large eggplant and slice it into 1/4 inch rounds. Salt the eggplant and let it sit for 15 minutes. The salt will draw out the bitterness that eggplant can sometimes have. While that is resting, combine a liberal amount of olive oil with minced garlic and a handful of cilantro in a bowl. After 15 minutes, dip each side of your eggplant into the olive oil mixture and place the round on the grill. Grill for 2-3 minutes a side and remove. For the salsa, combine 4-5 tomatoes, a bunch of cilantro, and one jalapeno to the food processor. Pulse a couple of times until chunky consistency is achieved. Add in one can of black beans and canned or freshly grilled corn (off the cob). Mix together with a little bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Plate eggplant and a few big spoonfuls of your fresh salsa on top and you've got a quick, easy, healthy weeknight dinner!"},{id:2,img:"cliantro-chicken.jpg",name:"Cilantro Lime Chicken",desc:"A simple 20 minute marinade A simple 20 minute marinade is all you need for this delicous, juicy chicken recipe.",rec:"Mix together one large handful of chopped cilantro, the juice of one lime, two tablespoons of honey, a liberal drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, one clove of minced garlic, and a large pinch (or two) of salt, pepper, and onion powder.

Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan with two cloves of minced garlic and half of a sweet onion. After a few minutes, add in your shrimp. Cook until they are pink and cooked through squeezing the juice of half a lemon toward the end of their cooking and some lemon zest to taste as well.

Next start building your salad with stockier, harder vegetables on the bottom so that the dressing doesn't sog up your greens. I put carrots, radishes, and shelled edamame and summer corn in the bottom of mine. Next add your greens. I prefer a spring mix, but whatever you have on hand will work fine. Lastly add a sprinkle of feta cheese and seal them up for an easy weekday lunch.
